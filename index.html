        <h2>Chapter 1: Greatest City in America</h2>
        <p>
          The self-proclaimed &#34Greatest City in America&#34 is a ninety-two square mile expanse sitting like a jewel on the Atlantic coast. Originally it was dubbed the &#34Monumental City&#34 by John Quincy Adams, who referred to its resiliance while the rest of the country was in shambles. During times of crisis it seemed to grow stronger. This historic city isn&#39t without its internal struggles. Poverty, corruption and riots eventually took their toll. The morale of residents dropped to a record low during the 1970&#39s. With a last ditch effort, advertisers and politicians conspired to perform a sort of mass incantation. They attempted to hypnotize the general public into contendness by re-branding to &#34Charm City&#34.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like a melting mirage, the charm eventually faded in the eyes of the outside world. &#34Murder Capital of Modern Times&#34 became the slogan commonly reported by journalists trying to fill their news slots. You wouldn&#39t know the struggles from asking anyone who lives in the city. The inhabitants are still under the spell. With thick grins and glazed eyes they will swear it is a paradise, completely unique and full of marvelous things. However, if you ask a simple a question to the supermarket clerk or cross the street too slowly, you get a sobering clue of the grating interactions that take place. The most accurate characterization was made by Nina Simone, who sang tenderly of a &#34hard town by the sea&#34. Baltimore City, the city of charms and death, can be described in one word â€“ Eclectic.

          &#34A City of Firsts&#34 is another early moniker gifted to this border metropolis between North and South. Baltimore established a post office system, water company, commercial railroad and public aquarium before anyone else in the nation. Its traditions are inherently American, flaws included, and is the birthplace of the Star Spangled Banner. The city is also where religious freedom was tried and tested. America broke its worldy shackles by being home to the first Catholic Diocese and Archdiocese. To this day it holds important yearly meetings of Catholic Bishops from all around the country. Baltimores 481 churches create a skyline brimming with spires, as if a bed of spikes for fallen angels. Only god knows how many corrupted divinities have landed in this pit.

         The closest neighboring major city is Washington, D.C. with 210 churches. That is less than half the churches you can find walking around Baltimore. Some witty Baltimorians argue this is the reason for depravity among politicians in the nation&#39s capital. According to them, if the founding fathers had realized the jewel that was forty miles northeast, we would be living in a utopia by now.

        Within Baltimores three century year old boundaries are 103 cemeteries. They are peppered throughout the chaotic soup of city dwellers with their variety of dogs, cats and reptiles. The amount of cemeteries doesn&#39t mean much. For example, Colma, California has 1.5 million tombstones spread across eighteen cemeteries. With only two thousand people actually living and breathing, it is no surprise why it is known as the &#34City of Souls&#34. Baltimore can only gawk wide eyed at Colma&#39s prowess in providing housing for the dead. Compared to other cities in the US: Austin containing 89, New York City with 68, Chicago with 43, Boston with 24 and Los Angeles, the &#34City of Angels&#34, with only 23; Baltimores high number is another innocuous sign of its cultural authority.

        Wandering the streets of the city, most likely near one church or other, was Molly. She was 7 years old, and suddenly aware of something so beautiful and so serene that it stopped her in her tracks: Music! Someone was singing outside with a voice sweet and full of life such that she couldn&#39t help chasing it. Following the sound, Molly quickly made her way towards what she considered as a miracle. She had to make it there before it stopped, before the person singing finished and left without a trace. She had to know who was creating this elixir of euphony for her ears. In that moment, it seemed to be her only reason for existing.
        </p>
        <p>
        About two blocks the opposite direction, in one of the 103 cemeteries around Baltimore, was Molly&#39s tombstone. It was dated 1929.
