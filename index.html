        <h2>Chapter 1: Greatest City in America</h2>
        <p>Sitting like a jewel at the center of the Atlantic coast is the Greatest City in America. It is a 92 square-mile metropolis seaport with strong history and stronger-headed people. As the City of Firsts, it pioneered a post office system, water company, commercial railroad and public aquarium. After the War of 1812, while the country was still in ruins, John Quincy Adams dubbed it the Monumental City. Its resilient shores inspired the National Anthem, which became first published in many of its newspapers. Times of crisis seemed to make it grow stronger. </p>
        <p>The city played a major role in the fight for religious freedom in America. Before the Revolution, the baron of the city passed a law in the colonies to require religious freedom, known as the Act Concerning Religion. He also helped establish a Catholic Diocese and Archdiocese. Britain soon underwent a &#34Glorious Revolution&#34 and outlawed the practice of Catholicism. This led to chaos and bloodshed in the colonies. The city was strictly under Protestant control up until the country gained its independence. Now many different variations of Christianity are practiced safely, led heavily by the city&#39s early efforts. </p>
        <p>Churches have since sprouted like weeds. There currently are 481 houses of prayer creating a skyline brimming with spires, like a bed of spikes for fallen angels. Only god knows how many corrupted divinities have since landed in this pit. The closest neighboring major city, Washington, D.C, only has 210 churches. That is less than half the churches you can find walking around the Greatest City. Some witty citizens argue that this is the reason for our current state of depravity among politicians. According to them, if the founding fathers had realized the religious mecca laying forty miles northeast of the current capitol, we would be living in a utopia by now. </p>
        <p>Within its three century old boundaries are 103 cemeteries. They are peppered across the chaotic soup of buildings, roads and city dwellers, who themselves live with a surprising variety of pet dogs, cats, birds, fish and reptiles. The number of cemeteries is another relatively large number compared to other cities in the US: Austin containing 89, New York City with 68, Chicago with 43, Boston with 24, and Los Angeles  the &#34City of Angels&#34,  with only 23. However, the amount of cemeteries doesn&#39t actually mean much in terms of deceased. For example, Colma, California is known as the &#34City of Souls&#34. With two thousand living residents and 18 cemeteries to house 1.5 million tombstones, the Greatest City can only gawk wide-eyed at Colma&#39s prowess of providing housing for the dead. </p>
        <p>Nowadays, while you can still find park benches with the proudly labeled Greatest City in America moniker, its reputation has dropped significantly. &#34Murder Capital of Modern Times&#39&#39 is the slogan more commonly reported by journalists. Poverty, corruption and riots eventually took toll on the city and morale of the residents dropped to a record low. During the 1970&#39s, local advertisers and politicians colluded to perform a sort of mass incantation. By rebranding to Charm City, they successfully hypnotized the general public back into contentment. Many of the residents fell under this spell. With thick grins and glazed eyes, they will swear that the city is a paradise, completely unique and full of marvelous things. However, any visitors who happen to ask too many questions to their supermarket clerk, walk too slowly when crossing the street, or ask too politely for their next beer at the bar, will realize the dark truth. Grating interactions are the daily ritual. To outside eyes, the charm has already faded and the city has become a paradox. Baltimore; a city of charms and death ; the city Nina Simone had sung tenderly about as the &#34hard town by the sea&#34, can be described in one word - Eclectic.</p>
        <p>Wandering the streets of Baltimore, most likely near one church or other, was Molly. She was 7 years old, and became suddenly aware of a thing so beautiful and serene that it stopped her in her tracks: Music! Someone was singing outside with a voice sweet and full of life. It broke her out of a stooper so intensely, that she couldn&#39t help chasing it. Molly made her way quickly, following the sound without care of cars or people, towards what she considered as a miracle. She had to know who was creating this elixir of euphony for her ears. She had to make it there before they stopped; before the person finished, packed up and left without a trace. In that moment, it seemed to be her only reason for existing.</p>
        <p>About two blocks the opposite direction of the music, in one of the 103 cemeteries around Baltimore, was Molly&#39s tombstone. It was dated 1929.</p>
