        <h2>Chapter 1: Greatest City in America</h2>
        <p>
          Baltimore City can easily be described in one word: Eclectic. Sung tenderley by Nina Simone as the &#34hard town by the sea&#34;; Tactfully labeled &#34Charm City&#34 by local advertisers in the seventies; &#34Murder capitol of modern times&#34 as reported by hungry young journalists; The self-proclaimed &#34Greatest City in America&#34 meets and surpasses all epithets given to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within its two hundred year old bounderies there are 103 cemeteries peppered on the chaotic soup of inhabitants, their dogs, cats and reptiles. Compared to other cities in the US: Austin containing 89; New York City with 68; Chicago with 43; Boston with 24; Los Angeles, the &#34City of Angels&#34, with only 23; This number is a seemingly innocuous sign of Baltimores cultural authority, which it has many.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of cemeteries doesn&#39t mean much. For example, the city of Colma, California has 1.5 million tombstones spread across only eighteen cemeteries. With two thousand people actually living and breathing, there is no question why it is known as the &#34City of Souls&#34. Baltimore can only gawk wide eyed at Colma&#34s prowess in providing housing to the dead. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The closest neighboring major city is Washington, D.C. with 56 cemeteries and 210 churches. That is less than half the churches you can find walking around Baltimore. It could be argued that this is the reason for the current state of depravity among politicians in the nations capitol. If only the founding fathers had realized the gem that was 40miles northeast. 481 houses of prayer give the city a skyline brimming with spires, as if creating spikes for fallen angels to land on. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since Baltimores inception it was misunderstood and underrated. However there was never a lack of innovation throughout its history. Religious freedom and tolerance was tried and tested, being home to the first Catholic Diocese in the entire country. Baltimore would also establish the first post office system and water company in the nation. Its position as a border city between North and South, a port linking America to the rest of the world, would lead it to be known as &#34A City of Firsts&#34. This story is no exception.
        </p>

          Wandering the streets of the city, most likely near one church or other, was Molly. She was 7 years old, and suddenly aware of something so beautiful and so serene that it stopped her in her tracks: Music! Someone was signing outisde with a voice sweet and full of life such that she couldn&#34t help but begin chasing it. Following the sound, she quickly made her way towards what she considered as a miracle. She had to make it there before it stopped, before the person singing finished and left without a trace. She had to know who was creating this elixir of euphony of her ears, it seemed to be her true purpose of existance at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that very moment, about two blocks away, in one of the 103 cemeteries in Baltimore, was Molly&#34s tombstone. It was dated 1929.
