        <h2>Chapter 1: Greatest City in America</h2>
        <p>
          The self-proclaimed &#34Greatest City in America&#34 surpasses all epithets given to it. Tactfully labeled as &#34Charm City&#34 by local advertisers in the seventies, an update to the historic &#34Monumental City&#34 by John Quincy Adams, was a response to the general low morale of its residents. In later years, &#34Murder Capital of Modern Times&#34 became the commonly reported slogan by hungry journalists trying to fill time slots. The charm, just like most curses, seems to have eventually worn off. You wouldn&#39t know this from asking anyone who lives in the city. With thick grins and glazed eyes they will swear it is a paradise, completely unique and full of marvelous things. They are still under its spell. However, if you lazily try to walk across the street or ask simple questions to a supermarket clerk, then you get a sobering clue to the grating interactions that take place. The most accurate characterization was made by Nina Simone, who sang tenderly about a &#34hard town by the sea&#34. Baltimore City, the city of charms and death, can be described in one word: Eclectic.

          &#34A City of Firsts&#34 is another early moniker gifted to this ninety-two square mile border city between North and South, serving as a port linking to the rest of the world. Its traditions are inherently American, flaws included, and is known as the &#34Birthplace of the Star Spangled Banner&#34. Baltimore established the first post office system, water company, commercial railroad and public aquarium in the nation. Religious freedom and tolerance was tried and tested, by being home to the first Catholic Diocese and Archdiocese in the entire country. It still holds important yearly meetings of catholic Bishops from around the country.

          The closest neighboring major city is Washington, D.C. with 210 churches. That is less than half the churches you can find walking around Baltimore. Some witty Baltimorians might argue this is the reason for depravity among politicians in the nation&#39s capital. According to them, if the founding fathers had realized the gem that was forty miles northeast, we would be living in a utopia by now. Baltimores 481 houses of prayer create a skyline brimming with spires, as if a bed of spikes for the angels to fall on when cast out of heaven. Only god knows how many corrupted divinities have landed in this pit.

         Within the three hundred year old boundaries are 103 cemeteries. They are peppered throughout the chaotic soup of city inhabitants with their dogs, cats and reptiles. The amount of cemeteries doesn&#39t mean much. For example, Colma, California has 1.5 million tombstones spread across eighteen cemeteries. With only two thousand people actually living and breathing, it is no surprise why it is known as the &#34City of Souls&#34. Baltimore can only gawk wide eyed at Colma&#39s prowess in providing housing for the dead. Compared to other cities in the US: Austin containing 89, New York City with 68, Chicago with 43, Boston with 24 and Los Angeles, the &#34City of Angels&#34, with only 23; Baltimores high number is another innocuous sign of its cultural authority throughout history.

         Wandering the streets of the city, most likely near one church or other, was Molly. She was 7 years old, and suddenly aware of something so beautiful and so serene that it stopped her in her tracks: Music! Someone was singing outside with a voice sweet and full of life such that she couldn&#39t help chasing it. Following the sound, Molly quickly made her way towards what she considered as a miracle. She had to make it there before it stopped, before the person singing finished and left without a trace. She had to know who was creating this elixir of euphony for her ears. At the time, it seemed to be her only reason for existing.

        About two blocks the opposite direction, in one of the 103 cemeteries around Baltimore, was Molly&#39s tombstone. It was dated 1929.
